### Building the platform for understanding student engagement and retention

native builds and operates the technology behind a managed marketplace for student engagement. For advertisers, native provides structured ad products, data infrastructure, and analytics tools. For Students' Unions, native provides the Campus Engagement Platform (CEP), which includes booking management, payment handling, and the Engagement Insights Dashboard (EID)—providing engagement scoring, benchmarks, demographic insights, analytics, and KPIs.

Our goal is to increase student engagement while enabling Students’ Unions to secure sustainable funding. For advertisers, we offer meaningful, measurable routes to student audiences. The more aligned these incentives are, the more defensible and scalable our business becomes.
